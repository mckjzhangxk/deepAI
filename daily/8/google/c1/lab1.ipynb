Spinning up a virtual machine and running your jobs on it is the closest you can get to working with the public cloud as simply rented infrastructure. It doesn't take advantage of the other benefits that Google Cloud Platform provides -- namely the ability to forget about infrastructure and work with your scientific computation problems simply as software that requires to be run.\n",
